## Description
For this project, I was asked to build a simple quote application, that incorportated a CSS framework of my choice and must consume at least two APIs. 

I wanted the UI to have a clean, calming and classy look to it. I wanted it to be easy to navigate and for the user to have a simple and enjoyable experience. 

In order to achieve this I chose to work with bootstrap as this has a clean look and is simple to use, it also allowed me to build the basis of my site quite quickly and made styling very simple. 

The application uses 3 APIs in total:
- [Quotable](https://quotable.io/) created by [Luke Peavey](https://github.com/lukePeavey) for all the quotes 
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for the background images
- [MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:REST_API) for the author excerpt 

Throughout the project I have made use of local storage to store information and call at a later stage, I also made sure that the site was responsive by incorporating some media queries.
